1. Concrete Access

Physical: The technicians had iphone until the repair is done .

Credential: The technicians possessed the user's Password for her phone .

Data: Because they had the PIN, the OS granted them access to everything a normal user can access including gallery and other apps in phone.

2. Failed Controls

Software: The iPhone OS did NOT require a a password or face id to open the Photos app once the phone was unlocked.

Network: The repair facility's Wi-Fi allowed connections to The Internet bu that he accessed her facebook account .

Supervision: There was no camera or a the owner of the phone to watching the technician's screen physically.

3. Undetectable Actions

The iPhone logs show "App Opened," but they do NOT log what photos was viewed .

If the technician took a picture of the screen using their own phone, the iPhone OS cant detect this.

He can even see if there is any bank details or passwords screenshots which he can login later on

4. The Fatal Assumption

Apple assumed that demanding the user's PIN/Passcode was necessary for hardware repair.

Why it failed: Hardware repair changing a screen/battery often does NOT require Software access/OS login , but the policy forced users to hand over the keys to everything.
